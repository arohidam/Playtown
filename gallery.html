        <p>This Galery Tells About How The Childern Enjoys In Learning Diferent Things. </p><br>
        <span class="left"><img src="style/new1.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
        <h3>Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.</h3>
        <span class="center"><img src="style/new31.jpg" alt="example graphic"/></span>
        <h3>For a small child there is no division between playing and learning; between the things he or she does just for fun and things that are educational. The child learns while living and any part of living that is enjoyable is also play.</h3>
        <span class="center"><img src="style/new11.png" alt="example graphic" /></span>
        <h3>Children more than ever, need opportunities to be in their bodies in the world – jumping rope, bicycling, stream hopping, and fort building. It’s this engagement between limbs of the body and bones of the earth where true balance and centeredness emerge.</h3>
        <span class="center"><img src="style/new21.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
        <center><h3>Music education can help spark a child's imagination or ignite a lifetime of passion. When you provide a child with new worlds to explore and challenges to tackle, the possibilities are endless. Music education should not be a privilege for a lucky few, it should be a part of every child's world of possiblity. </h3></center>
        <span class="center"><img src="style/new4.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
         <center><h3>Films offer children a source of comfort, inspiration and creativity, and play an integral role in developing a child’s imagination and empathy. Along with the narrative of a film, personalities of beloved characters also teach important life lessons, and encourage children to believe in themselves.</h3></center>
          <span class="center"><img src="style/new10.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
          <center><h3>Holiday eating is a study in paradox. You're surrounded by food, but you're so busy shopping and cooking that you don't have time to eat. Then, when your blood sugar dips to the point of derangement, you make a desperate lunge for the closest foodstuff - and the next thing you know, you've eaten an entire box of regifted peppermint bark.</h3></center>
          <span class="center"><img src="style/new9.png" alt="example graphic" /></span>
          <center><h3>There are children playing in the streets who could solve some of my top problems in physics, because they have modes of sensory perception that I lost long ago.</h3></center>
          <span class="center"><img src="style/new5.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
          <center><h3>Friendship is not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything.</h3></center>
          <span class="left"><img src="style/new6.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
          <center><h3>It is the duty of all papas and mammas to forbid their children to drink coffee, unless they wish to have little dried-up machines, stunted and old at the age of twenty....I once saw a man in London, in Leicester Square, who had been crippled by immoderate indulgence in coffee; he was no longer in any pain, having grown accustomed to his condition, and had cut himself down to five or six cups a day.</h3></center>
